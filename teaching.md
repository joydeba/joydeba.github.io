# Teaching

- **Instructor** – Cloud Computing & Blockchain, Saskatchewan Polytechnic.  
- **Lecturer** – Computer Science & Engineering, Khulna University.  
- **Teaching Assistant** – University of Saskatchewan (2017–2024).  

I enjoy mentoring students and developing software engineering courses that connect theory to practice.
