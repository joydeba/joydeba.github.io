Welcome! I am a **PhD in Computer Science** from the University of Saskatchewan, specializing in Software Engineering, Backporting, Vulnerability Management, Stable Software Management, Big Data Management, and Machine Learning/AI to reduce software bugs and security issues.

With **19 research publications** in premier venues including ICSE, ICSME, and top-tier journals, I currently teach in the **Cloud Computing & Blockchain** program at Saskatchewan Polytechnic and continue my research in automated software backporting and AI-driven development tools.
