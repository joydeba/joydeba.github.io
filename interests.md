# Personal Interests

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm passionate about capturing life through photography and the strategic excitement of cricket.

## üì∏ Photography

Photography has been a lifelong passion that perfectly complements my analytical mindset from computer science. Through the lens, I explore:

### **Technical Photography**
- **Digital image processing** - Applying my computer science background to post-processing workflows
- **Computational photography** - Understanding the algorithms behind modern camera systems
- **HDR and panoramic techniques** - Combining multiple exposures for artistic and technical effects

### **Photographic Interests**
- **Landscape photography** - Capturing the natural beauty of Saskatchewan and beyond
- **Street photography** - Documenting everyday moments and urban life
- **Technology documentation** - Photographing conferences, workshops, and academic events
- **Portrait photography** - Working with colleagues and friends in academic settings

### **Equipment & Technical Approach**
- **DSLR and mirrorless systems** - Understanding sensor technology and lens optics
- **Post-processing workflow** - Using tools like Lightroom, Photoshop, and open-source alternatives
- **Color theory** - Applying scientific principles to achieve desired artistic effects
- **Photography software development** - Occasional projects combining coding with photography

The intersection of technology and art in photography appeals to both my creative and analytical sides, much like the balance I seek in software engineering between functionality and elegant design.
